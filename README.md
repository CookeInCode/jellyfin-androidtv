A customized version of the popular Android TV client application tailored specifically for Jellyfin users, **users!**

Changes from Official Repository;
- Distinguishes itself clearly from the official version when installed concurrently.
- Includes a workaround to rectify the unattractive app icon display problem on the Amazon Firestick.
- Offers auto-suggestion/population of a default server addresses during setup (requires the use of Android Studio to modify the auto-suggestion server address).
