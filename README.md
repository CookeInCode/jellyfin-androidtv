A customized version of the popular Android TV client application tailored specifically for Jellyfin users, **users!**

Modifications from the Official Repository:
- The package name has been altered, enabling concurrent installation with the official version.
- It distinctly sets itself apart from the official version.
- It provides automatic suggestion/population of default server addresses during setup (modification of the auto-suggestion server address requires the use of Android Studio).
